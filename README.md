# Chess AI Project

This is a project (currently in development), where I will make a chess bot to play against.

Currently, you can move the pieces, highlight squares and draw arrows. 

Update 2: Moves have been validated.

I am working on a menu system and a simple bot for the next update.

I release beta versions that you can play here:

I am also working on a documentation website here:
> https://codepen.io/Paracosm-Arcana/full/VwgodBK

This project is made with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), which is a JavaScript library that allows me to draw to the screen without using HTML and CSS.

The only thing that isn't made by me are the pieces, which are by CBurnett.
